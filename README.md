## Description

In a past life I was in film school and learning how to become a successful film Director. I wrote and directed my first film, and created my own Production Company called Infinity Forever. After my brother became a professional actor and our Cousins invited us to their yearly Oscar's Party-- It became time to make more films!

I decided to build out a website for Infinity Forever to house all our films, pictures from our various shoots, our Instagram and YouTube pages, as well as all our upcoming futures, and a complete write up "About Us" and our Company. This website was created with our fans in mind, and whoever else is interested to check out our films.

**\***I am not 100% sold on our current logo-- I am always in the lab tweaking as much information as possible. There will be a new logo that we will introduce our next film with!
